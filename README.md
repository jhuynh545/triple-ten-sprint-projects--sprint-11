Sure Tomorrow insurance company seeks to leverage Machine Learning to address key business challenges:

Customer Similarity: Develop a method to identify customers similar to a given individual to assist agents in targeted marketing.

Benefit Prediction: Build and compare models to predict if a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Evaluate the model's performance against an untrained dummy model and provide explanations for the results.
Benefit Count Prediction: Use a linear regression model to estimate the number of insurance benefits a customer might receive.
Data Protection: Implement a data masking (or obfuscation) algorithm to safeguard clients' personal information. The algorithm should ensure data security without degrading the performance of machine learning models.

This project will demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of Machine Learning for solving these tasks while ensuring data privacy.
